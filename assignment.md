# VinoBuzz Internship Assignment

## Automated Wine Photo Sourcing — Accuracy Challenge

**Role:** Technical Intern (Part-time / Full-time)

**Deadline:** 48 hours from receipt

**Estimated Task Duration:** Track your actual time spent and report it in the write-up

**Submission:** Working demo + write-up (max 2 pages or 5 slides)

---

## Background

VinoBuzz (vinobuzz.ai) is Hong Kong's first AI wine marketplace with 4,000+ SKUs. Every listing requires a high-quality product photo. We currently source these photos using an automated pipeline — but accuracy sits at around  **50%** . That's not good enough.

Your job: **design and build a better pipeline that hits 90% accuracy.**

---

## Photo Standard

Before starting, visit **vinobuzz.ai/marketplace** and study the product photos. The standard:

* Single bottle, upright
* Clean white or neutral grey background
* Label clearly readable, correct angle
* No blur, no glare, no lifestyle props, no watermarks
* No AI-generated images — must be real product photos

---

## The Core Problem

Finding a photo is easy. Finding the **right** photo is hard.

Our current system fails because it finds a photo of the right producer — but wrong appellation, wrong specific vineyard (climat), or wrong vintage label. In Burgundy especially, names look nearly identical:

* *Domaine Leflaive Puligny-Montrachet* vs *Domaine Leflaive Puligny-Montrachet Les Pucelles 1er Cru* — completely different wines, easy to confuse
* *Olivier Leflaive* vs *Domaine Leflaive* — different producers, similar name

A wrong photo on a wine listing destroys customer trust. We'd rather show "no image" than show the wrong bottle.

---

## The Challenge

Design a pipeline that:

1. Finds a photo for each wine SKU from the web
2. **Verifies** the photo is correct before accepting it
3. Handles cases where no good photo exists
4. Runs at scale — fast enough to process thousands of SKUs

Think about:

* How do you confirm the label text matches exactly? (Producer, appellation, specific vineyard/cru)
* How do you automatically filter out low quality, watermarked, or lifestyle images?
* What's your confidence scoring mechanism?
* What's your fallback when no verified photo can be found?
* How do you handle wines with near-zero online photo coverage?

**Target: 90% accuracy on the 10 test SKUs.**

## Tools

Use anything: Python, LangChain, GPT-4V, Google Custom Search API, SerpAPI, Playwright, vision models, OCR, etc. We care about results and thinking, not your stack.

---

## Deliverables

1. **Working demo** — run on all 10 test SKUs, output includes:

* * Photo URL found (or "No Image" if none verified)
  * Confidence score per SKU
  * Pass / Fail verdict per SKU

2. **Write-up (max 2 pages or 5 slides):**

* * Your pipeline design and verification approach
  * How you handle false positives (wrong photo that looks right)
  * Biggest failure modes and how you handled them
  * **Total time spent on this task** (design + build + test)
  * What you'd improve with more time or resources

---

*We're not just testing if you can find photos. We're testing if you can build something accurate enough to trust at scale.*
